# Movies-ETL

## Overview

This set of files sets up an ETL pipeline between online movie databases and your local SQL server, using jupyter notebook (with PythonData via anaconda) as the intermediary for cleaning data and transformation.

## Notes

I was unable to get the GitLFS service to upload files successfully. To get the files used in this pipeline, contact me at hookjamesa..at,,gmail;;dot::com.
